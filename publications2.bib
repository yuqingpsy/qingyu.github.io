   abstract = {In natural scenes, multiple objects are usually presented simultaneously. How do specific areas of the brain respond to multiple objects based on their responses to each individual object? Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that the activity induced by a multiobject stimulus in the primary visual cortex (V1) can be predicted by the linear or nonlinear sum of the activities induced by its component objects. However, there has been little evidence from electroencephelogram (EEG) studies so far. Here we explored how V1 responded to multiple objects by comparing the EEG signals evoked by a three-grating stimulus with those evoked by its two components (the central grating and 2 flanking gratings). We focused on the earliest visual component C1 (onset latency of approximately 50 ms) because it has been shown to reflect the feedforward responses of neurons in V1. We found that when the stimulus was unattended, the amplitude of the C1 evoked by the three-grating stimulus roughly equaled the sum of the amplitudes of the C1s evoked by its two components, regardless of the distances between these gratings. When the stimulus was attended, this linear spatial summation existed only when the three gratings were far apart from each other. When the three gratings were close to each other, the spatial summation became compressed. These results suggest that the earliest visual responses in V1 follow a linear summation rule when attention is not involved and that attention can affect the earliest interactions between multiple objects.},

   abstract = {A previous study by Williams et al. (2008) provided evidence for a novel form of feedback in the visual system, whereby peripheral information is contained in foveal retinotopic cortex. Beyond its possible implication for peripheral object recognition, few studies have examined the effect of a direct behavioral manipulation of the foveal feedback representation. To address this question, we measured participants' peripheral visual discrimination performance while modulating their foveal representation in a series of psychophysical experiments. On each trial, participants discriminated the identities of briefly presented novel, three-dimensional objects or the orientations of gratings in a peripheral location while fixating at the center. Besides the peripheral target, another stimulus (foil) was also presented and masked at the fovea. Our results showed that for objects, when the foveal foil that was identical to the peripheral target was presented 150 ms after the onset of the peripheral target, visual discrimination of the peripheral target was improved. This congruency effect occurred even though participants did not consciously perceive the foveal stimulus. No such effect was observed when the foveal foil was presented simultaneously with the peripheral target, or when the foil was presented in a parafoveal location. The foil effect in gratings was different from that in objects in terms of its effective timing and foveal specificity, suggesting that foveal feedback may be specific to high-level objects. These results indicate that modulating foveal information can affect individuals' ability to discriminate peripheral objects, suggesting a functional role of foveal representations in peripheral visual perception.},

However, less is known about whether the mnemonic information of multi-feature objects is modulated by task demand in the parietal and frontal regions. To address this question, we asked participants to remember either color or orientation of one of the two colored gratings for a delay. Using fMRI and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, feature-selective responses in the occipital, parietal and frontal cortices during memory maintenance. We found that not only orientation but also color information can be maintained in higher-order parietal and frontal cortices as well as the early visual cortex when it was cued to be remembered. Conversely, neither the task-irrelevant feature of the cued object, nor any feature of the uncued object was maintained in the occipital, parietal, or frontal cortices. These results suggest a highly selective mechanism of visual working memory that maintains task-relevant features only.},

   abstract = {Although the manipulation of load is popular in visual working memory research, many studies confound general attentional demands with context binding by drawing memoranda from the same stimulus category. In this fMRI study of human observers (both sexes), we created high- versus low-binding conditions, while holding load constant, by comparing trials requiring memory for the direction of motion of one random dot kinematogram (RDK; 1M trials) versus for three RDKs (3M), or versus one RDK and two color patches (1M2C). Memory precision was highest for 1M trials and comparable for 3M and 1M2C trials. And although delay-period activity in occipital cortex did not differ between the three conditions, returning to baseline for all three, multivariate pattern analysis decoding of a remembered RDK from occipital cortex was also highest for 1M trials and comparable for 3M and 1M2C trials. Delay-period activity in intraparietal sulcus (IPS), although elevated for all three conditions, displayed more sensitivity to demands on context binding than to load per se. The 1M-to-3M increase in IPS signal predicted the 1M-to-3M declines in both behavioral and neural estimates of working memory precision. These effects strengthened along a caudal-to-rostral gradient, from IPS0 to IPS5. Context binding-independent load sensitivity was observed when analyses were lateralized and extended into PFC, with trend-level effects evident in left IPS and strong effects in left lateral PFC. These findings illustrate how visual working memory capacity limitations arise from multiple factors that each recruit dissociable brain systems.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Visual working memory capacity predicts performance on a wide array of cognitive and real-world outcomes. At least two theoretically distinct factors are proposed to influence visual working memory capacity limitations: an amodal attentional resource that must be shared across remembered items; and the demands on context binding. We unconfounded these two factors by varying load with items drawn from the same stimulus category ("high demands on context binding") versus items drawn from different stimulus categories ("low demands on context binding"). The results provide evidence for the dissociability, and the neural bases, of these two theorized factors, and they specify that the functions of intraparietal sulcus may relate more strongly to the control of representations than to the general allocation of attention.},

   abstract = {Stimulus location is not always informative during visual short-term memory (VSTM) for nonspatial features. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence for the automatic encoding and retention of location information, regardless of its task relevance. To explore the functional and neural bases of the representation of spatial context in VSTM for nonspatial information, functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed while subjects performed delayed recall for the orientation of individual stimuli. Stimulus location varied across trials, and although this information was irrelevant for task performance, multivariate pattern analysis decoding of stimulus location sustained across trials, and also the decoding strength, predicted the precision of the recall of orientation. The influence of spatial context on the representation of orientation was operationalized by comparing the orientation reconstructions with multivariate inverted encoding models (IEM) trained in location context-dependent vs. -independent data. Although orientation reconstructions were robust for both location-dependent and location-independent IEMs, they were markedly stronger for the former. Furthermore, the functional relevance of location context was demonstrated by the fact that only the location-dependent neural representations of stimulus orientation predicted recall precision. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural representation strength of stimulus location predicts the precision of visual short-term memory (VSTM) recall of nonspatial stimulus, even when this information is task irrelevant. Neural representations of nonspatial stimuli that incorporate location context are stronger than those that do not, and only the former representations are strongly linked to behavior. The contributions to nonspatial VSTM performance of the representation of location context are at least partly distinct from those of the representation of stimulus content.},

   abstract = {When perception differs from the physical stimulus, as it does for visual illusions and binocular rivalry, the opportunity arises to localize where perception emerges in the visual processing hierarchy. Representations prior to that stage differ from the eventual conscious percept even though they provide input to it. Here, we investigate where and how a remarkable misperception of position emerges in the brain. This "double-drift" illusion causes a dramatic mismatch between retinal and perceived location, producing a perceived motion path that can differ from its physical path by 45 degrees or more. The deviations in the perceived trajectory can accumulate over at least a second, whereas other motion-induced position shifts accumulate over 80-100 ms before saturating. Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, we find that the illusory path does not share activity patterns with a matched physical path in any early visual areas. In contrast, a whole-brain searchlight analysis reveals a shared representation in anterior regions of the brain. These higher-order areas would have the longer time constants required to accumulate the small moment-to-moment position offsets that presumably originate in early visual cortical areas and then transform these sensory inputs into a final conscious percept. The dissociation between perception and the activity in early sensory cortex suggests that consciously perceived position does not emerge in what is traditionally regarded as the visual system but instead emerges at a higher level.},

Previous work on whether parietal and frontal regions convey mnemonic information has yielded mixed findings. One possibility for this variability is that the mnemonic representations in high-level frontoparietal regions are modulated by attentional priority, such as temporal order. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the most recent item, which has a higher attentional priority in terms of temporal order, is preferentially encoded in frontoparietal regions. On each trial, participants viewed 2 gratings with different orientations in succession, and were cued to remember one of them. Using fMRI and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, orientation representations in occipital (V1-V3), parietal (IPS), and frontal (FEF) areas during memory maintenance. Unlike early visual cortex where robust orientation representations were observed regardless of serial order, parietal, and frontal cortices showed stronger representations when participants remembered the second grating. A subsequent experiment using a change detection task on color rings excluded the possibilities of residual stimulus-driven signals or motor preparative signals for responses. These results suggest that mnemonic representations in parietal and frontal cortices are modulated by temporal-order-based attentional priority signals.},

   abstract = {Successful retrieval of an item from visual working memory (VWM) often requires an associated representation of the trial-unique context in which that item was presented. In experiment 1, fMRI of 16 male and female humans replicated a previous dissociation of the effects of manipulating memory load in comparison to the effects of manipulating context binding, by comparing VWM for one oriented line versus for three lines individuated by their location versus for three "heterogeneous" items drawn from different categories (orientation, color, and luminance): delay-period fMRI signal in frontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was sensitive to stimulus homogeneity rather than to memory load per se. Additionally, inspection of behavioral performance revealed a broad range of individual differences in the probability of responses to nontargets (also known as "swap errors"), and a post hoc comparison of high swap-error versus low swap-error groups generated several intriguing results: at recall, high swap-error subjects were seen to represent both the orientation and the location of the probed item less strongly, and with less differentiation from nonprobed items, and delay-period signal in IPS predicted behavioral and neural correlates of context binding at recall. In experiment 2, which was a preregistered replication, the 27 male and female humans were grouped into low and high swap-error groups by median split, and the results were broadly consistent with experiment 1. These results present a neural correlate of swap errors, and suggest that delay-period activity of the IPS may be more important for the operation of context binding than for representation per se of stimulus identity.},

   abstract = {Working memory is imprecise, and these imprecisions can be explained by the combined influences of random diffusive error and systematic drift toward a set of stable states ("attractors"). However, the neural correlates of diffusion and drift remain unknown. Here, we investigated how delay-period activity in frontal and parietal cortex, which is known to correlate with the decline in behavioral memory precision observed with increasing memory load, might relate to diffusion and drift. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. To quantify the influence of drift and diffusion, we modeled subjects' behavior using a discrete attractor model and calculated within-subject correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and whole-trial estimates of drift and diffusion. We found that although increases in frontal and parietal activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison, a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift, rather than diffusion, explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex. These results are consistent with a model of the differential recruitment of general frontoparietal mechanisms in response to diffusive noise and of stimulus-specific biases in occipital cortex.},

   abstract = {We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural codes for representing stimulus information held in different states of priority in working memory. Human participants (male and female) performed delayed recall for 2 oriented gratings that could appear in any of several locations. Priority status was manipulated by a retrocue, such that one became the prioritized memory item (PMI) and another the unprioritized memory item (UMI). Using inverted encoding models (IEMs), we found that, in early visual cortex, the orientation of the UMI was represented in a neural representation that was rotated relative to the PMI. In intraparietal sulcus (IPS), we observed the analogous effect for the representation of the location of the UMI. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a common remapping mechanism that may be responsible for representing stimulus identity and stimulus context with different levels of priority in working memory.},

Here, we investigated the neural representation of purely internally generated stimulus-like information during visual working memory. Participants performed delayed recall of oriented gratings embedded in noise with varying contrast during fMRI scanning. Their trialwise behavioral responses provided an estimate of their mental representation of the to-be-reported orientation. We used multivariate inverted encoding models to reconstruct the neural representations of orientation in reference to the response. We found that response orientation could be successfully reconstructed from activity in early visual cortex, even on 0% contrast trials when no orientation information was actually presented, suggesting the existence of a purely internally generated neural code in early visual cortex. In addition, cross-generalization and multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrated that information derived from internal sources was represented differently from typical working memory representations, which receive influences from both external and internal sources. Similar results were also observed in intraparietal sulcus, with slightly different cross-generalization patterns. These results suggest a potential mechanism for how externally driven and internally generated information is maintained in working memory.},

To explore the neural bases of the strategic control of context binding in WM, we acquired fMRI while subjects performed delayed recognition of 3 orientation patches presented serially and at different locations. The recognition probe was an orientation patch with a superimposed digit, and pretrial instructions directed subjects to respond according to its location ("location-relevant"), to the ordinal position corresponding to its digit ("order-relevant"), or to just its orientation (relative to all three samples; "context-irrelevant"). Delay period signal in PPC was greater for context-relevant than for "context-irrelevant" trials, and multivariate decoding revealed strong sensitivity to context binding requirements (relevant vs. "irrelevant") and to context domain ("location-" vs. "order-relevant") in both occipital cortex and PPC. At recognition, multivariate inverted encoding modeling revealed markedly different patterns in these 2 regions, suggesting different context-processing functions. In occipital cortex, an active representation of the location of each of the 3 samples was reinstated regardless of the trial type. The pattern in PPC, by contrast, suggested a trial type-dependent filtering of sample information. These results indicate that PPC exerts strategic control over the representation of stimulus context in visual WM.},

However, it has remained poorly understood how imagery experience derives volitionally as opposed to being cue driven. Here, using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we systematically investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of self-generated imagery by having participants volitionally imagining one of the orientations from a learned pool. We contrast self-generated imagery with cue-induced imagery, where participants imagined line orientations based on associative cues acquired previously. Our results reveal overlapping neural signatures of cue-induced and self-generated imagery. Yet, these neural signatures display substantially differential sensitivities to the two types of imagery: self-generated imagery is supported by an enhanced involvement of the anterior cortex in representing imagery contents. By contrast, cue-induced imagery is supported by enhanced imagery representations in the posterior visual cortex. These results jointly support a reverse cortical hierarchy in generating and maintaining imagery contents in self-generated versus externally cued imagery.},

   abstract = {Humans constantly receive massive amounts of information, both perceived from the external environment and imagined from the internal world. To function properly, the brain needs to correctly identify the origin of information being processed. Recent work has suggested common neural substrates for perception and imagery. However, it has remained unclear how the brain differentiates between external and internal experiences with shared neural codes. Here we tested this question in human participants (male and female) by systematically investigating the neural processes underlying the generation and maintenance of visual information from voluntary imagery, veridical perception, and illusion. The inclusion of illusion allowed us to differentiate between objective and subjective internality: while illusion has an objectively internal origin and can be viewed as involuntary imagery, it is also subjectively perceived as having an external origin like perception. Combining fMRI, eye-tracking, multivariate decoding, and encoding approaches, we observed superior orientation representations in parietal cortex during imagery compared with perception, and conversely in early visual cortex. This imagery dominance gradually developed along a posterior-to-anterior cortical hierarchy from early visual to parietal cortex, emerged in the early epoch of imagery and sustained into the delay epoch, and persisted across varied imagined contents. Moreover, representational strength of illusion was more comparable to imagery in early visual cortex, but more comparable to perception in parietal cortex, suggesting content-specific representations in parietal cortex differentiate between subjectively internal and external experiences, as opposed to early visual cortex. These findings together support a domain-general engagement of parietal cortex in internally generated experience.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How does the brain differentiate between imagined and perceived experiences? Combining fMRI, eye-tracking, multivariate decoding, and encoding approaches, the current study revealed enhanced stimulus-specific representations in visual imagery originating from parietal cortex, supporting the subjective experience of imagery. This neural principle was further validated by evidence from visual illusion, wherein illusion resembled perception and imagery at different levels of cortical hierarchy. Our findings provide direct evidence for the critical role of parietal cortex as a domain-general region for content-specific imagery, and offer new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the differentiation between subjectively internal and external experiences.},

   abstract = {Previous working memory research has demonstrated robust stimulus representations during memory maintenance in both voltage and alpha-band activity in electroencephalography. However, the exact functions of these 2 neural signatures have remained controversial. Here we systematically investigated their respective contributions to memory manipulation. Human participants either maintained a previously seen spatial location, or manipulated the location following a mental rotation cue over a delay. Using multivariate decoding, we observed robust location representations in low-frequency voltage and alpha-band oscillatory activity with distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: location representations were most evident in posterior channels in alpha-band activity, but were most prominent in the more anterior, central channels in voltage signals. Moreover, the temporal emergence of manipulated representation in central voltage preceded that in posterior alpha-band activity, suggesting that voltage might carry stimulus-specific source signals originated internally from anterior cortex, whereas alpha-band activity might reflect feedback signals in posterior cortex received from higher-order cortex. Lastly, while location representations in both signals were coded in a low-dimensional neural subspace, location representation in central voltage was higher-dimensional and underwent a representational transformation that exclusively predicted memory behavior. Together, these results highlight the crucial role of central voltage in working memory, and support functional distinctions between voltage and alpha-band activity.},

Previous working memory research has revealed distributed neural representations of task information across cortex. However, how the distributed task representations emerge and communicate with stimulus-specific information to implement flexible goal-directed computations is still unclear. Here, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants along with state space analyses, we provided converging evidence in support of a low-dimensional neural geometry of goal information congruent with a designed task space, which first emerged in frontal cortex during goal maintenance and then transferred to posterior cortex through frontomedial-to-posterior theta coherence for implementation on stimulus-specific representations. Importantly, the fidelity of the goal geometry was associated with memory performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that abstract goals in working memory are represented in an organized, task-congruent neural geometry for communications from frontal to posterior cortex to enable computations necessary for goal-directed behaviors.},
